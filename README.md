This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to use information from the webpack lessons to practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage that uses JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website.

Note: DOM elements should be created using JavaScript but styling can be done in a separate CSS file.
